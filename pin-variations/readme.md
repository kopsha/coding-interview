# Hacking all PIN variations

Suppose that you are part of a team that breaks electric locks.
The way the team operates is rthat there is a spy that overlooks what
pin is introduced into the lockâ€™s keyboard and reports it to you.
Unfortunately he is not completely sure that he saw the correct combination
and all adjacent (vertical and horizontal) keys of a key could be the correct
key.

Given a keyboard and a reported pin, your task is to generate all possible
variations of the observed pin. The pin can have any length.

_Example_:
```python
keyboard = [
    ['1', '2', '3'],
    ['4', '5', '6'],
    ['7', '8', '9'],
    ['*', '0', '#'],
]

Reported_pin = '13'

Possible variations = ['13', '23', '43', '12', '22', '42', '16', '26', '46']
```
_Explanation_: Adjacent keys of 1 are 2 and 4 and adjacent keys of 3 are 2 and 6
