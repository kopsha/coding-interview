# Valueworks Programming Challenge

We want to test your programming skills by giving you a short programming challenge. The challenge is to 

1. Ungroup a tree to an array of tree nodes.
2. Group an array of tree nodes into a tree.

You are asked to implement the following functions in `hierarchy.py` so that they pass the provided tests. Your implementation should support any trees of any arbitrary size.

* `ungroup`

Flatten a tree into an array of tree nodes.

* `group`

Build a tree from an array of tree nodes

The tests can be run using:

    pytest test_hierarchy.py
